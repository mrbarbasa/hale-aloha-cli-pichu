= 1.0 Prerequisites =

You must have Ant 1.8.1 and Java 1.6 installed.  We also provide .project and .classpath files for Eclipse, although that IDE is not mandatory for development. 

= 2.0 Installation =

== 2.1 Run Ant to install libraries required for compilation ==

After checkout out the sources from SVN, or else downloading the distribution, you must start by invoking "ant" at the top level of the project:

{{{
% ant
}}}

 This will do the following:

 * Download Ivy.
 * Use Ivy to download packages required for compilation, including JUnit and Robocode. 
 * Compile the system.

If you cannot successfully compile the system, please contact the project owner for help. 

== 2.2 Verify installation ==

Once compilation is successful, perform a "verification" of the system as follows:

{{{
% ant -f verify.build.xml
}}}

This command will run JUnit, Checkstyle, PMD, !JavaDoc, and !FindBugs, and fail the build if any warnings are issued by these tools.  It will also download these packages using Ivy.  

If the verification does not succeed, then contact the project owner for help before proceeding. 

= 3.0 Development Guidelines =

Once you have verified your local installation of hale-aloha-cli-pichu, you are ready for development.    We follow these development guidelines:

  * We use Eclipse for development, and format the code using [http://ics-software-engineering.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/configfiles/eclipse.format.xml this format]. 

  * For new features, please add an Issue that specifies what you plan to do. 

  * Please develop a JUnit test case (either before, during, or after) development of a new feature to ensure it works.

  * Before committing changes, please make sure that "ant -f verify.build.xml" runs successfully.
